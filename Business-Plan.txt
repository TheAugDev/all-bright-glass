3.0 Market Analysis
3.1 Industry Overview
The commercial cleaning and building maintenance industry is a robust market driven by the constant need to maintain the appearance and structural integrity of commercial real estate. Within this sector, specialized services like high-rise window cleaning and glass restoration command a premium due to the high skill level, specialized equipment, and significant safety risks involved. Clients in this space are often less price-sensitive and prioritize reliability, insurance coverage, and proven expertise.

3.2 Target Market

Commercial Property Management Firms: Companies managing Class A office buildings and commercial portfolios.

Hospitality Sector: High-end hotels and resorts where pristine aesthetics are paramount to the guest experience.

Construction Companies: General contractors who require professional, final cleanup of windows and facades on new development projects.

3.3 Competitive Analysis
The DMV area has numerous window cleaning services, but few possess the specialized equipment and expertise for high-rise work and advanced glass restoration. We will differentiate ourselves through the proven expertise of our team, our superior customer service, and our comprehensive suite of restoration services.

4.0 Organization & Management
4.1 Management Team
Our lean and experienced management team is structured for efficiency and expertise in a remote-work environment:

Head of Operations & Technical Services - Arnel Oco

Sales & Marketing Lead - Jun Doydora Jr.

Administrative & Operations Managers - Ian & Aa-ne Ravago

Financier - Teresita Clave Schell

4.2 Personnel Plan
Initially, operations will be lean. Arnel Oco will serve as the primary on-site contractor. To supplement our initial capacity, we will engage other experienced, independent contractors on a per-project basis. This strategy allows us to scale our workforce flexibly. Once the business achieves a steady stream of contracts, we will transition to hiring and training an in-house team of technicians.

4.3 Compensation, Profit-Sharing, & Referral Structure
Our compensation model is designed to maximize motivation and align the entire team toward profitability.

Profit-Sharing Distribution: The management team will not draw salaries. Compensation will be via a share of the company's net profits, distributed as follows:

Arnel Oco: 35%

Teresita Clave Schell: 25%

Jun Doydora Jr.: 22%

Ian & Aa-ne Ravago: 18%

Fieldwork Compensation: When Arnel Oco performs direct technical labor, he will be compensated separately as an independent contractor. This is a "Labor" cost and is deducted before net profit is calculated.

Tiered Finder's Fee Program:

Fee Structure: 
• 5% for contracts up to $25,000
• 8% for contracts from $25,001 to $75,000  
• 10% for contracts over $75,000

Public Referrals: A one-time fee is paid for the initial contract with a new client.

Internal Referrals (Lifetime Commission): Management members (Arnel, Ian, Aa-ne, Teresita) will receive a lifetime commission on all business from a client they refer.

Ineligibility: Jun Doydora Jr. is not eligible for finder's fees, as sales are his primary role.

5.0 Services
All Bright Glass Cleaning Services offers five core service areas:

• Glass Restoration Services: Our glass restoration and glass renewal services often save a substantial amount of money when compared to glass replacement. Commercial window glass restoration and glass scratch removal are an art form that we have perfected over the years.

• Glass Stains and Hard Water Stain Removal: Many high rise buildings get glass stains due to exposure to the elements, high amounts of tap water from sprinkler system overspray, or minerals leaching from adjacent pre-cast concrete onto the glass surfaces. Removing mineral stains and etching from glass is our specialty.

• Glass Scratch Removal Services: Glass with scratches does not need to be the problem that it has been in the past. Glass is getting more costly every year, and restoration makes more sense, and saves more money than ever.

• Seal/Coating Service: We offer our Seal System for your glass windows, doors and shower doors. When seal is applied, it creates a protective barrier that eliminates porous, water stain due to heavy rains, soap build up and chemicals. It keeps them looking new and shine longer.

• Window Cleaning Services: We are also a window cleaning business. We are dedicated to serving our customers and all of us pledge to uphold the highest of quality standards at all times to thoroughly meet your needs.

6.0 Marketing & Sales Strategy
Our strategy is focused on direct B2B engagement and building a reputation for excellence. We will leverage our professional website, network through industry associations, and publish case studies. Our sales strategy will be consultative, featuring detailed proposals and a formal, tiered finder's fee program to generate qualified, low-cost leads.
